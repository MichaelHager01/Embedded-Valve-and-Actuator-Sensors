# Embedded-Valve-and-Actuator-Sensors

For my capstone project, our team was assigned to work with Bray to determine a method to directly measure valve position and actuator output torque independent of other parameters. In doing so, the team has utilized a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and an ADS1115 16 Bit ADC chip for data analysis using Python. This repository includes the code used for data analysis.
